My name is Jess Peter.

I'm a designer from Toronto currently living in Oslo.

In this blog, I'm documenting my work with the [Carnegie Mellon Textiles Lab's knitout](https://github.com/textiles-lab) file specification.

This work goes towards my Master's thesis. Assume a [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) everything by me unless otherwise stated. Talk to the Textile's Lab about code snippets by them for licensing details.
